# The Science of Terminology: History and Evolution

The advent of the science of terminology is the logical consequence of the recognition of serious deficits in professional communication.

Science of terminology has developed from practical issues such as guidelines and recommendations in order to remedy communicational deficits passing phases of intensified theorisation and testing to become a complete science.

Science of terminology today fulfils all the requirements of a science with regard to its theoretical foundations, a variety of applications, an active research community, well developed teaching and training activities at the academic and practical levels and extensive publishing activity.

# HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF IT TERMINOLOGY AND ITS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

IT terminology reflects the cutting-edge innovations in the field, providing a framework for discussing and understanding these developments. IT terminology is the backbone of effective communication within the technology sector and across various industries.

It promotes clarity, efficiency, and collaboration while ensuring that the IT field remains adaptable to rapid technological changes.

Terms like "big data," "machine learning," and "smart contracts" emerge not just as linguistic novelties but as indispensable tools for articulating complex ideas.

Precise, well-defined terminology ensures that our shared understanding of IT concepts remains unambiguous and globally accessible.

# Computer Jargon Explained

Computer jargon has a bad name.  It irritates non-computer people: it causes problems for computer people.  **The technology and the industry are changing so rapidly it is very hard even for professionals to keep up to date.** Computer people have to concentrate on the problems in hand: they do not have time to keep abreast of developments that do not immediately affect what they are doing.  Nonetheless, they are expected to be experts: to have instant, detailed, accurate answers to every question a non-specialist may pose them. **This book provides the solution for computer professionals who need that wider perspective.  It discusses 68 of the most commonly used technical computing terms.**  In each case it explains what the term means: in addition, it explains why the term is important to the computer professional, and how it relates to the trends and developments which are driving the information technology industry. The book is the brainchild of Nicholas Enticknap, a former computer professional and now established as one of the leading commentators on computer industry developments.  It is based on a series of articles he wrote for Computer Weekly under the heading Background Briefing.  The series, which appeared in instalments between November 1986 and January 1989, has been brought up to date and expanded with three appendices and a comprehensive index.
